# easy-opal

A command-line tool to easily set up and manage OBiBa Opal environments using Docker and NGINX. This tool provides a simple wizard for initial setup, as well as commands for managing the stack, Rock profiles, and configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Docker**: Required to run the Opal and Rock containers.
- **Git**: Required for the `update` command.
- **mkcert**: Required for creating locally-trusted SSL certificates for development.

The setup script will automatically install and configure these dependencies across all major platforms.

> üìñ **For detailed platform support, troubleshooting, and advanced options, see:** [**Cross-Platform Setup Guide**](./docs/SETUP_CROSS_PLATFORM.md)

## Recommended Setup

For the smoothest experience, we recommend:

### **Operating System:**

**‚úÖ Ubuntu 20.04+ / 22.04+** (Highly Recommended)
- Ships with Docker Compose V2 by default
- Excellent Docker integration
- All dependencies (curl, git, etc.) pre-installed
- Best networking compatibility

> **Note:** While easy-opal works on other Linux distributions and macOS, Ubuntu provides the most reliable experience with fewer setup issues.

### **Administrative Privileges:**

- **`sudo` access is required** for:
  - Installing system dependencies (Docker, git, curl, mkcert)
  - Docker daemon operations (if not in docker group)
  - SSL certificate installation (mkcert -install)

- **Add your user to the docker group** (recommended):
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  # Log out and back in for changes to take effect
  ```

### **Docker Requirements:**
- **Docker Engine 17.06+** (20.10+ recommended)
- **Docker Compose V2** preferred (falls back to V1 automatically)
- **At least 4GB RAM** available for containers
- **At least 20GB free disk space** for images, data, and build cache

> **üí° Tip:** If you encounter issues, check our comprehensive [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for distribution-specific solutions.

## Installation

The installation process is streamlined using Poetry for robust dependency and environment management.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/isglobal-brge/easy-opal.git
    cd easy-opal
    ```

2.  **Run the main setup script**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup
    ./setup
    ```
    
    **For systems with older Python versions (CentOS/RHEL/AlmaLinux):**
    ```bash
    ./setup --upgrade-python
    ```
    
    **For systems without Docker or with older Docker versions:**
    ```bash
    ./setup --upgrade-docker
    ```
    
    **For complete system upgrade (recommended for older systems):**
    ```bash
    ./setup --upgrade-python --upgrade-docker
    ```
    
    The setup script automatically handles:
    - ‚úÖ **System dependency detection** (Python 3.8+, Docker CE 17.06+, Git, curl)
    - ‚úÖ **Cross-platform installation** (Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Arch, Alpine, Gentoo, FreeBSD, macOS, etc.)
    - ‚úÖ **Python version upgrades** (fixes Poetry 2.x compatibility)
    - ‚úÖ **Docker CE installation** (with Compose V2 support)
    - ‚úÖ **Poetry installation** with virtual environment setup
    - ‚úÖ **SSL certificates** via mkcert (skip with `--skip-mkcert`)
    - ‚úÖ **Multi-tier fallback system** for maximum compatibility
    
    > üìã **Setup Options:**
    > - `./setup` - Standard installation
    > - `./setup --upgrade-python` - Install Python 3.8+ if needed (fixes Poetry issues)
    > - `./setup --upgrade-docker` - Install Docker CE with Compose V2
    > - `./setup --skip-mkcert` - Skip certificate tools (for reverse proxy setups)
    > - `./setup --upgrade-python --upgrade-docker` - Complete system upgrade

## Usage

All commands are run from the project root directory using the `./easy-opal` wrapper script.

### `setup`

The main command to configure or re-configure a stack. Running it without flags starts an interactive wizard.

-   `./easy-opal setup`

**Flags:**

-   `--stack-name TEXT`: The name of the Docker stack (e.g., `my-opal`).
-   `--host TEXT`: A hostname or IP for Opal. Can be used multiple times.
-   `--port INTEGER`: The external HTTPS port for Opal.
-   `--http-port INTEGER`: The local HTTP port for 'reverse-proxy' strategy.
-   `--password TEXT`: The Opal administrator password.
-   `--ssl-strategy [self-signed|letsencrypt|manual|reverse-proxy]`: The SSL strategy to use. See [SSL Configuration Guide](./docs/SSL_CONFIGURATION.md) for details.
-   `--ssl-cert-path TEXT`: Path to your certificate file (for 'manual' strategy).
-   `--ssl-key-path TEXT`: Path to your private key file (for 'manual' strategy).
-   `--ssl-email TEXT`: Email for Let's Encrypt renewal notices.
-   `--yes`: Bypasses all interactive prompts. Essential for scripting.
-   `--reset-containers`: Non-interactively stops and removes Docker containers.
-   `--reset-volumes`: Non-interactively deletes Docker volumes (all application data).
-   `--reset-configs`: Non-interactively deletes configuration files.
-   `--reset-certs`: Non-interactively deletes SSL certificates.
-   `--reset-secrets`: Non-interactively deletes the `.env` file.

**Example (Non-Interactive):**

```bash
./easy-opal setup \
  --stack-name new-stack \
  --host localhost \
  --port 8443 \
  --password "newpass" \
  --ssl-strategy "self-signed" \
  --yes \
  --reset-containers
```

---

### `reset`

Performs a factory reset of the environment. Running it without flags starts an interactive wizard.

-   `./easy-opal reset`

**Flags:**

-   `--containers`: Stop and remove Docker containers and networks.
-   `--volumes`: Delete Docker volumes (highly destructive).
-   `--configs`: Delete configuration files.
-   `--certs`: Delete SSL certificates.
-   `--secrets`: Delete the `.env` file.
-   `--all`: Selects all of the above options.
-   `--yes`: Bypasses the final confirmation prompt.

**Example (Non-Interactive):**

```bash
# Non-interactively delete everything
./easy-opal reset --all --yes
```

---

### Stack Lifecycle

-   `./easy-opal up`: Ensures the stack is running. If it's already running, it will be stopped and started again to apply any changes.
-   `./easy-opal down`: Stops the stack's containers.
-   `./easy-opal status`: Shows the status of the running containers.

---

### `diagnose`

Run comprehensive health diagnostics on your easy-opal installation. This command performs thorough testing of infrastructure, network connectivity, external access, security configurations, and service endpoints.

-   `./easy-opal diagnose`: Full diagnostic report with detailed results and troubleshooting guidance.
-   `./easy-opal diagnose --quiet`: Summary-only output, perfect for CI/CD systems and automated monitoring.
-   `./easy-opal diagnose --verbose`: Detailed output with additional debugging information.
-   `./easy-opal diagnose --no-auto-start`: Prevent interactive prompts to start the stack (for automated scenarios).

**What it tests:**

-   **üê≥ Infrastructure**: Docker Compose configuration and container status
-   **üîó Network Connectivity**: Inter-container communication (Opal‚ÜîMongoDB, Nginx‚ÜîOpal, Rock connections) with 2-minute retry logic for startup delays
-   **üåê External Access**: Port accessibility from host system with 2-minute retry logic for service startup
-   **üîí Security & Certificates**: SSL certificate validation with 2-minute retry logic for SSL service startup
-   **üíæ Service Health**: HTTP/HTTPS endpoint responses with 2-minute retry logic for web service initialization

**Output formats:**

```bash
# Full diagnostic with troubleshooting guidance
./easy-opal diagnose

# Quick health check (perfect for monitoring scripts)
./easy-opal diagnose --quiet

# When everything is healthy:
üéâ SYSTEM HEALTHY
   ‚úÖ All 6 tests passed - your easy-opal installation is working perfectly!

# When issues are detected:
üö® CRITICAL ISSUES DETECTED
   ‚ùå 2 failed, ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 warnings, ‚úÖ 3 passed
   Run './easy-opal diagnose' for detailed troubleshooting info
```

**Smart Stack Detection**: If the stack is not running, the diagnostic tool will:
-   Clearly indicate the stack is down instead of showing misleading test failures
-   Offer to automatically start the stack and then run diagnostics (interactive mode)
-   Provide clear next steps for manual stack startup (quiet/automated modes)

**Exit codes**: Returns the number of failed tests (0 = success), making it perfect for automated monitoring and CI/CD pipelines.

**Use cases:**
-   **Troubleshooting**: Quickly identify connectivity or configuration issues
-   **Health Monitoring**: Regular system health checks in production
-   **Post-Setup Validation**: Verify everything works after initial setup or changes
-   **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in deployment pipelines

## Data Persistence: Volumes vs. Local Directories

This tool uses a hybrid approach for data persistence to balance ease of management and Docker best practices.

-   **Local Directories (`./data`)**:
    -   **What**: Holds NGINX configuration, SSL certificates, and Let's Encrypt challenge data.
    -   **Why**: These are critical configuration files that you might need to inspect, modify, back up, or provide yourself (e.g., custom SSL certificates). Storing them in a local directory makes them transparent and easily accessible.

-   **Named Docker Volumes**:
    -   **What**: Used for all application-generated data, including the MongoDB database, Opal server data, and all Rock profile data.
    -   **Why**: This is the recommended Docker approach for managing the state of stateful applications. Docker manages the lifecycle of this data, which abstracts it from the host machine's filesystem, improves I/O performance, and simplifies data management across different environments.
